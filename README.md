# Expo Constants.deviceId Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where `Constants.deviceId` in Expo's Constants API returns `undefined` or `null` inconsistently. This makes it challenging to rely on the API for unique device identification.

## Bug Description

The `Constants.deviceId` property should provide a unique identifier for each device.  However, we've observed cases where it returns `undefined` or `null`, even when the app is fully loaded and has access to other device information.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using `expo start`.
3. Observe the output in the console. You may see `Constants.deviceId` return `undefined` or `null` on some launches, while returning a valid ID on others.

## Expected Behavior

`Constants.deviceId` should consistently return a unique identifier for the device whenever it is accessed after the app has initialized.

## Solution

The proposed solution uses a more robust method to attempt to generate and store a unique device identifier, falling back to other mechanisms if necessary.  This improves consistency and reliability.  However, there are limitations associated with persistent storage; refer to the solution file for more details.
