This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device-specific information, specifically the `deviceId` property.  Sometimes, `Constants.deviceId` returns `undefined` or `null` even after the app has been fully initialized. This is inconsistent and makes it difficult to reliably identify and track devices.
